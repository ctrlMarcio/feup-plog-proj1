## Who and What

> - identification of the project (game)
> - identification of the group
>   - group's name
>   - practical class
>   - UP's number and complete name of each element

## Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion?

**AKA game description**

> - brief description of the game and its rules (**max 300 words**)
> - biography (such as game official's page, rules' book, etc.)

>   - current player
>   - eventually captured pieces or yet to play
>   - other required information (depending on the game)
> - examples of representation in Prolog (which should also be in the code file)
>   - initial game state
>   - intermediate game state
>   - final game state
> - indication of the meaning of each atom, i.e., how the pieces are represented

## Visualization of the game state

> small description about the implementation of the predicate of the game state visualization (**max 200 words**)
